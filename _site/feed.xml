Between holiday plans and end of the year work projects, I usually only get to some of the puzzles in the coding advent calendar. Then I celebrate the new year and put it aside until next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided to do something a bit different. I am continuing into January. The puzzles are fun. Kind of a coding refresh for the brain. They are also a different style of problem than I usually solve, and I enjoy expanding my knowledge. I work with the same algorithms for work, and these push me. It keeps things fresh and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can visit their site and try out past advents of code beginning in 2015. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
