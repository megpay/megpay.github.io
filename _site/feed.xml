You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It might sound a little odd, talking about the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">adventofcode</a> in January, but every year I start it and every year I forget that December is an extremely busy month. Between holiday plans and end of the year work projects, I usually only get to some of the puzzles in the coding advent calendar. Then I celebrate the new year and put it aside until next year.</p>

<p>This time, I decided to do something a bit different. I am continuing into January. The puzzles are fun. Kind of a coding refresh for the brain. They are also a different style of problem than I usually solve, and I enjoy expanding my knowledge. I work with the same algorithms for work, and these push me. It keeps things fresh and interesting.</p>

<p>You can visit their site and try out past advents of code beginning in 2015. I recommend it.</p>
