It might sound a little odd, talking about the [adventofcode][adventofcode] in January, but every year I start it and every year I forget that December is an extremely busy month. Between holiday plans and end of the year work projects, I usually only get to some of the puzzles in the coding advent calendar. Then I celebrate the new year and put it aside until next year. 

This time, I decided to do something a bit different. I am continuing into January. The puzzles are fun. Kind of a coding refresh for the brain. They are also a different style of problem than I usually solve, and I enjoy expanding my knowledge. I work with the same algorithms for work, and these push me. It keeps things fresh and interesting. 

You can visit their site and try out past advents of code beginning in 2015. I recommend it.
